<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In preparation of continuing the work on .NET Core/Standard support for SpecFlow and recognising in talks at the MVP Summit, that it is not that simple to explain how SpecFlow works, I thought it would be good to start writing it done.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So as starting ponts, let&#x27;s have a look at the normal workflow, when you write a new Scenario?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ol>
<li>The user opens or creates a feature file, writes it Scenario in Gherkin and saves.</li>
<li>A code-behind file is generated, which contains code for a test class of the configured unit test provider. This could be SpecFlow+Runner, xUnit, NUnit, MsTest or MbUnit.</li>
<li>The user selects the line and presses F12.</li>
<li>A dialog opens, which contains a skeleton for a binding method for this sentence.</li>
<li>The user adds the skeleton binding code to a new or existing binding class</li>
<li>The user implements the binding. Probably with some helper methods from the TechTalk.SpecFlow.Assists namespace.</li>
<li>The user compiles its project</li>
<li>The user runs the tests</li>
<li>The tests are hopefully green.</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That&#x27;s a lot of steps to get from a scenario to a executed tests.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And these are the parts that are involved in this:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Generator
<ul>
<li>Code- Behind File generation</li>
<li>Plugins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;Runtime
<ul>
<li>Binding lookup</li>
<li>Assists</li>
<li>Plugins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Visual Studio Extension
<ul>
<li>Syntax Highlighting/IntelliSense</li>
<li>Navigation</li>
<li>Code- Behind Generation</li>
<li>Skeleton Generation</li>
<li>ItemTemplates</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>More than you would think, or?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Additionally SpecFlow has also a console application (specflow.exe), which also contains crucial functionality:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>SpecFlow.exe
<ul>
<li>generateAll Command</li>
<li>MSBuild tasks</li>
<li>Reports</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To make it easier to read for you (and to write for me), every major part will get it&#x27;s own blog posts. So you don&#x27;t have to wait until I am completely finished with everything. I will add links to the individual posts when they are ready.</p>
