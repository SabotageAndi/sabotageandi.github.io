For an upcoming spare time project I need a UI library that work cross- plattform (Windows, Mac OS and Linux). So I began to research research what possibilities are currently available.

I found following libraries:

- [Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/)
- [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/)
- [Avalonia UI](http://avaloniaui.net/)

Let's have a look at some general data of them.

|                    | Xamarin.Forms                        | Uno Platform | Avalonia UI |
|---|---|---|---|
| __Supported platforms__ | Androis, iOS, Windows, Mac OS, Linux | Android, iOS, Windows, WebAssembly | Windows, Mac OS, Linux |
...existing code...
