<p>During my preparation for my latest meetup talk, I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t able to switch to presenter mode in Visual Studio. The Quick launch tasks were simply not there.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What now? In the past they were part of the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.ProductivityPowerPack2017">productivity power tools extension</a>. This was installed, but no quick launch tasks for me. :-(</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After some research together with the audience, we found the reason. The presenter mode quick launch tasks were moved to a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.QuickLaunchTasks">separate extension</a> and this was not installed. The productivity power tools are now a meta extensions, that has dependencies on a lot of other extensions.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So after installing the extension and restarting VS I had the presenter mode back. So if you are searching it sometime in the future, the extension is called&nbsp;<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.QuickLaunchTasks">Quick Launch Tasks</a>.</p>

<p>PS: I am sure, that the extension was missing is due to my development setup, multiple dev machines (4 machines at 3 locations) and extension roaming. So no bad feeling against the extension developer for this.</p>
