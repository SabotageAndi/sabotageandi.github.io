      <description>Finally after 13 months, SpecFlow 2.2 and SpecFlow+ 1.6 (Runner and Excel) were finally released yesterday.
Here are the official release notes: http://specflow.org/category/release-notes.
Two changes make me very happy.
The first is the removal of the MSBuild dependency. This was always a pain, as MSBuild sometimes used a cached version of your current project which was not actual. So if you added files to your project, it could be that the code-behind-file generator does not know about it.</description>
