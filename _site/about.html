      <p>My name is Andreas Willich. I‚Äôm a software developer and hobby speaker and I am working at Tricentis in Vienna, Austria, but this blog, its content and opinions are my own.</p>

<p>I have the feeling that every week I have at least one new thing learned or I combined some information to get something new out of them. So I will write about this daily .NET developing challenges that I encounter.
Additionally I am inspired from Scott Hanselman handling of questions. As he gets a lot of questions asked, he doesn‚Äôt answer them only for the questioner, he writes a blog post with the answer and how he got it and only sends back a link to the blog post. So everybody gets some gain from it.</p>

<p>Additionally I am since January 2017 a Microsoft MVP in the ‚ÄúVisual Studio and Development Technologies‚Äù categories. And blog posts should help to get re-awarded again. üòâ</p>
