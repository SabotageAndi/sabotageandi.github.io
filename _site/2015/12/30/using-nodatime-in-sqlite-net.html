      <p>For a project I wanted to try out NodaTime, because of its nice handling with timezones.
In this project I have also to save the values into a SQLite database and for that I normally use SQLite.net for that.
Normally SQlite.net does not know how to handle the NodaTime types, but there are 2 places to add your own support for types.</p>

<h2 id="extratypemapping">ExtraTypeMapping</h2>
<p>You can specific for your types which SQLite type it should be. That could be INTEGER, REAL, TEXT or BLOB.
Itâ€™s a simply Dictionary&lt;System.Type, String&gt; you provide as constructor parameter, where you set the SQLite.net Type to BLOB.</p>

<h2 id="iblobserializer">IBlobSerializer</h2>
<p>When you save your values as Blob, you can use the BlobSerializerDelegate of SQLite.net and provide the appropriate delegates to serialize and deserialize your types.</p>

<p>When you combine both, you can simply save your own types as blob in your database.</p>

<p>The code for saving LocalDate, OffsetDateTime and Duration you can find here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/SabotageAndi/194aa01e1c78cb614c1b.">https://gist.github.com/SabotageAndi/194aa01e1c78cb614c1b.</a></p>

<p>It is in F#, but it is understandable by C#-only developers. ðŸ˜‰</p>
