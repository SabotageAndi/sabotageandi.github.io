      <description>I was trying to get SpecFlow to build under Mac OS and had some problems with an MSBuild target (https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/blob/master/Tests/TechTalk.SpecFlow.Specs/.build/build.targets#L32).
We need to replace some text in a file with a value which we only can access during build. For that we used the RoslynCodeTaskFactory. This has the benefit, of not having to write a whole MSBuild task. But I had problems that msbuild or dotnet build wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find the Microsoft.</description>

      <title>Xamarin.Forms &#43; F# &#43; Paket</title>

      <description>Yesterday I started a new Xamarin.Forms project in F# on my Mac. Because the NuGet experience isn‚Äôt the best in Visual Studio for Mac, I always use Paket for managing my dependencies.
Normally I am always following the steps here and here. But this time, after I have done everything, the project didn‚Äôt compile anymore.
After some time of fiddling with Paket (I am not the expert user of it) I found the solution.</description>

      <description>In preparation of continuing the work on .NET Core/Standard support for SpecFlow and recognising in talks at the MVP Summit, that it is not that simple to explain how SpecFlow works, I thought it would be good to start writing it done.
So as starting ponts, let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the normal workflow, when you write a new Scenario?
 The user opens or creates a feature file, writes it Scenario in Gherkin and saves.</description>

      <description>Sometimes after the .NET team announced that they will add global tools to .NET Core, I asked myself if it would be possible to combine them with Avalonia to make a global tool with an UI.
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know Avalonia, you should check it out. It&amp;rsquo;s an UI framework that uses XAML like WPF and Xamarin Forms and is implemented for .NET Framework and .NET Core. It runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.</description>

      <title>Where is my presenter mode?</title>

      <guid>https://willich.io/2018/02/23/where-is-my-presenter-mode/</guid>
      <description>During my preparation for my latest meetup talk, I noticed that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to switch to presenter mode in Visual Studio. The Quick launch tasks were simply not there.
What now? In the past they were part of the productivity power tools extension. This was installed, but no quick launch tasks for me. üôÅ
After some research together with the audience, we found the reason. The presenter mode quick launch tasks were moved to a separate extension and this was not installed.</description>

      <description>Last Monday (30. January) a colleague and I gave a talk about the basics of MSBuild. So that also others can enjoy my explanations, I wrote this post.
All examples can be found here:
Classic Hello World &amp;lt;Project Sdk=&amp;quot;Microsoft.NET.Sdk&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Target Name=&amp;quot;HelloWorld&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Message Text=&amp;quot;Hello World!&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/Target&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/Project&amp;gt;  Command: msbuild %Filename%.csproj /t:HelloWorld
That&amp;rsquo;s the classic &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; as for every programming language. And yes, MSBuild looks like XML, but it&amp;rsquo;s a programming language.</description>

      <description>A year ago I got out of nowhere following eMail:
I was awarded as a Microsoft MVP in the &amp;ldquo;Visual Studio and Development Technologies&amp;rdquo; Category. How cool is that? And how did this happen?
I had filled out a profile and entered my activities on https://mvp.microsoft.com/, but the feedback that I got months before the eMail, was that a little bit is missing and it needed a some more activities to become a MVP.</description>

      <title>Multiple projects in the same folder</title>

      <description>In SpecFlow+ we are supporting multiple different versions of SpecFlow (currently 1.9, 2.1 and 2.2) and so we have to test each version with the full set of our test suite. As we don&amp;rsquo;t want to copy a lot of code and then change some references/package version, I was looking if it is without much pain possible, that you have multiple projects/csprojs in one folder and produce so multiple assemblies. We are already having a solution with the old project system, but it involves a lot of linked files and manual editing of the project files.</description>

      <title>Uninstall .NET Core SDKs on macOS</title>

      <description>During checking for a build error on Mac OS X of the Gherkin parser, I wanted to uninstall all my installed .NET Core SDKs, to have a clean slate.
In my search how to do this, I found this script in the .NET Core repo: https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/master/scripts/obtain/uninstall/dotnet-uninstall-pkgs.sh
Steps to use:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/cli/master/scripts/obtain/uninstall/dotnet-uninstall-pkgs.sh chmod +x dotnet-uninstall-pkgs.sh sudo ./dotnet-uninstall-pkgs.sh  After that, you have removed all .NET Core SDKs from your Mac and you can start from the beginning to install new ones.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago in a project we had a XamlParseException when a special page was opened. Strange thing was, that we didn‚Äôt change anything of the XAML- Code, since the last working version. There were only some small changes in the code-behind of the page.
The error message was following: Windows.UI.Xaml.Markup.XamlParseException: ‚ÄòThe text associated with this error code could not be found. Failed to create a ‚ÄòUWPSystemTypeConverterTest.Converter.EnumTypeConverter‚Äô from the text ‚Äòenums:CustomEnum‚Äô.</description>

      <description>Finally after 13 months, SpecFlow 2.2 and SpecFlow+ 1.6 (Runner and Excel) were finally released yesterday.
Here are the official release notes: http://specflow.org/category/release-notes.
Two changes make me very happy.
The first is the removal of the MSBuild dependency. This was always a pain, as MSBuild sometimes used a cached version of your current project which was not actual. So if you added files to your project, it could be that the code-behind-file generator does not know about it.</description>

      <title>Using SpecFlow&#43;Runners Parallelization Features</title>

      <guid>https://willich.io/2016/04/08/using-specflow-runners-parallelization-features/</guid>
      <description>To start a parallel test run, you simply need to change the testThreadCount property in your srProfile to a number higher than 1. How your tests are executed then depends on the testThreadIsolation property.
The upcoming release of SpecFlow+Runner 1.4 adds an additional mode (SharedAppDomain), so I thought it time to explain this new option and the two existing ones (this option is already available in the pre-release version of 1.</description>

      <description>In the last days I completed the first version of FFRAB-Mobile (see here). I used F# and Xamarin.Forms to gain more experience in a bigger project than a simple example app. You can find the sources here: https://github.com/SabotageAndi/ffrab-mobile
Here are my impressions:
Writing stateless could be hard, but it is worth the trouble Coming from a C# background, now writing code that is near complete stateless is new and unusual.</description>

      <description>This blog post is outdated! Use VS Code and Ionide.
After some days working with Atom to write in F# code, here are some tips:
Read the manual and use the ionide-installer package üòâ On my first try I installed some ionide packages and so some features where missing. So really read the manual and use the ionide-installer package.
On Mac OS X ‚Äì use the Mono package and not the one from Homebrew When you are using the Homebrew version, Ionide can not spawn the background service for the autocompletion.</description>

      <title>Using NodaTime in SQLite.Net</title>

      <guid>https://willich.io/2015/12/30/using-nodatime-in-sqlite.net/</guid>
      <description>For a project I wanted to try out NodaTime, because of its nice handling with timezones. In this project I have also to save the values into a SQLite database and for that I normally use SQLite.net for that. Normally SQlite.net does not know how to handle the NodaTime types, but there are 2 places to add your own support for types.
ExtraTypeMapping You can specific for your types which SQLite type it should be.</description>

      <description>So after playing with Suave.io, I wanted to add some new bleeding edge stuff to it. üòâ And run it on a beta environment, the DNX üôÇ
First, the complete source of it is here: https://github.com/SabotageAndi/SuaveAkkaCore
Thanks to Alxandr there is F# support for the DNX: https://github.com/YoloDev/YoloDev.Dnx.FSharp
So here is a quick go through of the code to get the stuff working:
1. Add needed NuGet feeds YoloDev: https://www.myget.org/F/yolodev/api/v2‚Ä≥ AspNetVNext: https://www.</description>

      <title>Playing With AngularJS and Suave</title>

      <guid>https://willich.io/2015/05/31/playing-with-angularjs-and-suave/</guid>
      <description>After I found Suave.IO (lightweight HTTP Server in F#) I wanted to try it out. As I also wanted to play with AngularJS (I know I am a little bit late, but normally I get out of the way of web development). So why not combine both and create a small webserver that hosts the web app and the webservices.
As example for the AngularJS app, I used the PhoneCat Tutorial App from AngularJS.</description>

      <title>F# Raw SQL Access</title>
      <link>https://willich.io/2014/09/03/f#-raw-sql-access/</link>

      <guid>https://willich.io/2014/09/03/f#-raw-sql-access/</guid>
      <description>With my start in working with F#, I came to the point to access a database. When you read my last post, you know that an ORM was out of question. What me really surprised at the end, was that the code is much less than every other DB access I wrote.
So how does it look?
The general idea was, to first create a record that holds the SQL statement and the parameters, that gets then executed.</description>

      <title>No More ORM</title>

      <guid>https://willich.io/2014/08/28/no-more-orm/</guid>
      <description>After working some years with different OR- Mappers (NHibernate, Entity Framework, proprietary ones, ‚Ä¶) to build a lot of line of business applications, I came to the conclusion to trash them.
So how did I come to this conclusion? Yes, ORMs make it on the first look easy to access your database and query them. That is it all what you get. But you also get some problems, that were not there before.</description>
