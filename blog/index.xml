      <description>Two weeks ago in a project we had a XamlParseException when a special page was opened. Strange thing was, that we didn’t change anything of the XAML- Code, since the last working version. There were only some small changes in the code-behind of the page.
The error message was following: Windows.UI.Xaml.Markup.XamlParseException: ‘The text associated with this error code could not be found. Failed to create a ‘UWPSystemTypeConverterTest.Converter.EnumTypeConverter’ from the text ‘enums:CustomEnum’.</description>

      <description>Finally after 13 months, SpecFlow 2.2 and SpecFlow+ 1.6 (Runner and Excel) were finally released yesterday.
Here are the official release notes: http://specflow.org/category/release-notes.
Two changes make me very happy.
The first is the removal of the MSBuild dependency. This was always a pain, as MSBuild sometimes used a cached version of your current project which was not actual. So if you added files to your project, it could be that the code-behind-file generator does not know about it.</description>
