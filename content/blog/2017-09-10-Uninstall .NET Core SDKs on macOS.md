During checking for a [build error](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin-dotnet/pull/6) on Mac OS X of the Gherkin parser, I wanted to uninstall all my installed .NET Core SDKs, to have a clean slate.

In my search how to do this, I found this script in the .NET Core repo: <https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/master/scripts/obtain/uninstall/dotnet-uninstall-pkgs.sh>

Steps to use:

``` bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/cli/master/scripts/obtain/uninstall/dotnet-uninstall-pkgs.sh
chmod +x dotnet-uninstall-pkgs.sh
sudo ./dotnet-uninstall-pkgs.sh
```

After that, you have removed all .NET Core SDKs from your Mac and you can start from the beginning to install new ones. 😉
