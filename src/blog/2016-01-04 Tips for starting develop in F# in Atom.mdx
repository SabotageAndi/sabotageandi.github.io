# This blog post is outdated!

Use VS Code and Ionide.




After some days working with Atom to write in F# code, here are some tips:

## Read the manual and use the ionide-installer package ðŸ˜‰

On my first try I installed some ionide packages and so some features where missing. So really read the manual and use the ionide-installer package.

## On Mac OS X â€“ use the Mono package and not the one from Homebrew

When you are using the Homebrew version, Ionide can not spawn the background service for the autocompletion.
If you use the Mono one from <http://www.mono-project.com/download/> everything works.
Additional this package includes the reference assemblies for Portable Class Libraries. Without them you can not compile a PCL.

## Additional packages

git-plus: <https://atom.io/packages/git-plus> â€“ git commands available in command palette
terminal-plus: <https://atom.io/packages/terminal-plus> â€“ terminal within Atom; when you use a german keyboard, you have to adjust the key mappings for toggle
minimal: <https://atom.io/packages/minimap> â€“ file preview on the right side

## using Yeoman and the generator-fsharp

Yeoman with the F#- Generator (<https://github.com/fsprojects/generator-fsharp)> is a nice tool for creating new projects from templates.
I added some new features in the last view days:

add FAKE support (<https://github.com/fsprojects/generator-fsharp/pull/26)>
add references to other projects (<https://github.com/fsprojects/generator-fsharp/pull/26)>
add template for PCLs with Profile 259 (<https://github.com/fsprojects/generator-fsharp/pull/25)>
Hopefully they will be merged in the next days.
